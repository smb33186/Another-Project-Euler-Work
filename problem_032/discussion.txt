Solution Discussion
===================
(2015/10/02) solution_01.c
	Decided to start with a very straight forward approach to see how it would
	perform. Realized that, given the constaints, the multiplican and multipler
	values could never be more than 4 digits (hence the 9999 limits). If either
	of these numbers had more than 4 digits, then the product would have more
	than 4 digits too and we'd be over the maximum of 9 possible digits.

	This code would not be good for anything beyond a one-time use since the
	duplicate detection portion uses a hard-coded length array since I knew I
	did not have more than 10 pandigitals within the range to deal with.
	


Verification
============
2015/10/02 - Failed: 56370
	First go at the problem and got a result so I tried it.
2015/10/02 - Succeed: 45228
	Forgot to account for the duplicates as hinted at by the note. :)
