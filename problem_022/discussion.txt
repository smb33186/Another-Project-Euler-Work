Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/02/12)
At first I started thinking this was an good problem to try mmapping a file in
to memory.  However, since the tokenizer modified the original memory location
and I wanted to make sure that didn't get pushed back to the file, I decided to
just read it once directly and then manipulate that one block of memory.

Used strtok to parse the string and split it into the individual name tokens.
As the names were parsed, their scores were calculated and then they were
inserted into a double-linked list.  This part was very simple to get working
and was easy.

Final score was as easy as traversing the list and calculating the score along
the way.


Verification
============
2013/02/12 - Failed: 870885382
	First attempt after getting the program working.
2013/02/12 - Succeed: 871198282
	The first name was being skipped by mistake.  strtok already skipped
	deliminters at the first of the string.
