Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/09/23)
After thinking about it for a little while, I noticed a couple things that would
help to greatly reduce the number of combinations necessary for testing.

* When n = 0, b must be prime since it is the only contributor to the result.
	0^2 + a*0 + b = b
* When n = 1, a must be an odd number for the result to be a prime number:
	1^2 + a*1 + b = 1 + a + b = a + b = (p - 1)
	- b is already negative since it is a prime number
	- a + b must be even to make it an odd when adding 1
* When n = 1, a > -b otherwise the result would be a negative number and not a
  prime.
