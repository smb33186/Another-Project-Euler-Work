Solution Discussion
===================
(2015/10/02)
	Started with a very basic and straight forward greedy algoritm starting with
	the largest values and trying progressively small pence combinations until a
	match was found. I vaguely remember from somewhere a rule with this style of
	"box filling" problems that starting with a greedy algorithm of the biggest
	values typically is a reliable strategy.


Verification
============
2015/10/02 - Failed: 72161
	First attempt. Just typed out the solution and tried running it on the first
	successful compliation.
2015/10/02 - Succeed: 73682
	Had a small bug in my logic that was skipping out of some combinations too
	soon. If the sum was more than 200 pence, I was terminating at that point.
	But, that was wrong since the small pence values were tested later.
