Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/02/16)
I had a small assumption error with my calculation.  When the remainder went
perfectly into the remaining combinations, I was thinking that would mean it was
the "start of the next" row.  But after working through an example, I realized
that in that case, it was the very last combination of that range.


Verification
============
2013/02/10 - Failed: 2561834709
	Tried to figure it out by hand.  But I guess I have something wrong in my
	math.
2013/02/10 - Failed: 2783915604
	Tried again by hand because I thought I had made a mistake with some of my
	work but I guess not.
2013/02/10 - Failed: 2783915406
	Tried a third time after working through a small example to validate my
	strategy.  So I must still have a math error somehwere I'm pretty sure.
