Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/01/14)  Just looped over the months and added up the days.  Anywhere that
the day count modulated by 7 was zero meant that day was on a Sunday.


Verification
============
2013/01/14 - Failed: 16
	Just tried the first result that popped up.
2013/01/14 - Succeed: 171
	My strategy was actually correct.  But, I was accidentally only going from
	1991 through 2000 instead of 1901 through 2000.
