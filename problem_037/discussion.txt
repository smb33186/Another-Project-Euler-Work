Solution Discussion

	Took a while to finally get this one. I got 10 of the 11 pretty quickly on a
	first run through of the problem. I kept thinking I was just limiting the
	range of the primes too much so I extended it out. After reading around on
	Wolfram's side about truncated primes, I saw the problem that I was having.
	I had included a check to rule out all even digits figuring when they were
	in the lowest position, the number wouldn't be a prime. However, this
	caused issues with the digit 2 as it is prime when by itself.
