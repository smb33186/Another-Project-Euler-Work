Solution Discussion
===================
(2015/10/05)
	Knowing that the fraction had to have 2 digits in both the numerator and
	denominator, combined with the fraction having to be less than one,
	constrained the space of the denominator from 99..11 and the numerator
	always being (d-1)..11. This all combined to pretty heavily reduce the
	number of combinations that needed to be tested. From there, it was just
	getting the two digits in both and doing a simple comparison.


Verification
============
2015/10/05 - Failed: 200
2015/10/05 - Succeed: 100
	I reduced the four fractions themselves but not the product of those four
	fractions.
