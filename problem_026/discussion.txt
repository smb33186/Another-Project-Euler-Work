Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/09/12)
After understanding some of the problem a bit better and doing some research, I
was able to get it pretty easily.  If it wasn't for filtering out all the
non-prime numbers first, the check for a remainder of 1 would not have worked.
I got this from some of the discussion comments from one of the resources
referenced.

It's not too surprising that the longest decimal sequence is 1 less than that
prime (982 for prime 983).  Since we are using the remainder, and since we abort
on a remainder of 1, there are up to that prime-1 possibilities.
