Solution Discussion
===================
(2010/12/23)

I just took the isPrime routine discussed in Problem #7 and implemented it here.


Verification
============
2010/12/23 - Failed: 142913828920
	(I had sarted my summing off at 0 instead of accounting for skipping the 2
	prime)
2010/12/23 - Failed: 224172088209
2010/12/23 - Succeed: 142913828922
	(I had missed some checks with my isPrime routine and that threw things
	off.)
