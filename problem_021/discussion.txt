Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/02/10)
The problem with my first attempts was that I was doing the multiplication for
only up to half of the MAX as needed but I wasn't checking the second half of
the range for amicable pairs.  Since I only check when the divisor sum is less
than the current number (because I'm populating the multiples from lowest to
highest), I was stopping too soon when checking for pairs.

	Had an adding error in my code.  Still incorrect answer though.
