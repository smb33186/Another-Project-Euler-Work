Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/02/06)  Spent a while researching some of the big int multiplication and
division strategies.  Didn't end up using any of them due to complexity for
these smaller problems.  Multiplication is fairly easy but division turns out to
be a bit messier.

Once all the extra routines were added to handle the number management, this one
was pretty straight forward.

Verified solution using Python to calculation 100!.
