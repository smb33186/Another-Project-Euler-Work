This one was fairly straight forward for finding the pattern in the numbers.
The spiral did not need to actually be populated.  For each "loop" around the
spiral, there are 4 corners and they are all separated by an equal step size.

I think the most tricky part of this question was making sure that a long
integer is being used due to overflow.
