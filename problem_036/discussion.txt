Solution Discussion
===================
(2015/10/17)
	After a moment of thinking, I realized this problem could be solved by
	cutting off the lowest digit (of either base) and pushing it on to the end
	of an accumulator variable; thereby reversing the digits of the number.
	If the numbers were palendromic, then the original and the "reversed"
	result would be equal to each other.
