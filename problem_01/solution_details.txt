Solution Discussion
===================

This problem can be fairly easily simplified and use some of the basic math
principles to find the answer instead of having to add up all the numbers
one-by-one.

3 + 6 + 9 = 18
		  = (3*1) + (3*2) + (3*3)
		  = 3(1 + 2 + 3)

Then using the sum of numbers from 1..n rule: sum = n(n+1)/2

n = 3 ->
	3(n(n+1)/2) = 3(3(4)/2) = 3(3(2)) = 3(6) = 18

The same rule can be applied for any multiple that we are looking at.

So finding n when the final number is m, where m = 10 from the sample.

m / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.3333

Simply take the lower bound (integer portion) of the result and that gives you
the n for the multiple base number.

However, 10 / 5 = 2, but we are only suming multiples < m.  So we need to ignore
the second multiple in this case.  Or, more genearlly, if the multple goes into
m evenly, we need to ignore the last.

This can be accounted for by using (m-1) instead of m when determining the value
of n for the multiple.  Any multiple that goes into (m-1) evenly, would still be
smaller than m and, therefore, a value multiple to include.  For a number that
already evenly divides into m, using (m-1) will account for ignoring that last
term in determining n.
