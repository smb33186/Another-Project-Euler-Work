Solution Discussion
===================
(2010/12/13)

After trying for a while to think of a smarter and more clever approach, I
finally just settled for now on a simple and more brute force approach.
However, I did optimize in that I skipped all even numbers by incrementing the
number by 2 each iteration.

I had to modify my factor function to make an isPrime function that tests if the
number is a prime or not.  I know I could improve the isPrime function that
would properly take into account the sqrt upper bound for the number.  But my
first attempt with it was not turning out quite right.  So I scrapped it for
now.
