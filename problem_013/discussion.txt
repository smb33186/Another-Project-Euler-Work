Solution Discussion
===================

I started thinking about representing the numbers as doubles which gives 16
digits of accuracy and hoping that the routing and overflow from adding those
numbers would not impact the 10 highest digits of the result.  But that seemed
like it would have been a risky assumption to make given only 16 digits of
precision and asking for the 10 most significate.  So I started looking around a
bit more and came across a different approach that looked like it would scall
better.  I think this will be the best approach for this problem.  However, I
haven't implemented it yet:
