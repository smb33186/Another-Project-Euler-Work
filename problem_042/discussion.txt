Solution Discussion
===================
(2017/03/31)
My first answer was incorrect since I was using a zero-based index when doing
my subtraction. (A = 0, but A should be 1.) To simplify the math when growing
the reference array, it was easy to simplify the equation in terms of the
previous number instead of doing the power. Bother would have been easy though.

Parsing the file was pretty easy but I had to think through my pointer and
buffer addressing. Had accidentally missed adding the starting offset in when
determining the ending pointer location and this was causing me to have some
partial words.
