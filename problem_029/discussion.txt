Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/10/16)
Used a quick Python program to get the result for verification.  Still
investigating why the C program didn't work.

As it turns out, after spending some time trying to figure out why I was
matching more duplications, I found the reason: integer overflows.  I had
defined the power field to be a 1-byte char and with some of the higher power
and larger base numbers, I was overflowing the power field for my number
representation.  After upping the size to be a 2-byte short instead, I matched
the results of the Python validation exactly.

I have not looked at the other user's answers yet to see if my idea of breaking
the numbers into their factors and comparing them that way instead of actually
calculating the numbers was a common approach.


Verification
============
2013/10/16 - Failed: 9025
	First try using the linked list idea and looking at the factors.
2013/10/16 - Success: 9183
