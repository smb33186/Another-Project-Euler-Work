Solution Discussion

Just decided to go with the simple approach on this problem and just iterate
through the number's digits.  I was trying to think of a good way to avoid
having to multiply the same set of digits over and over but the zeros in the
number were throwing kinks in my plans that wouldn't have required more checking
for every digit.  I thought the checks would end up adding more time than the
simple multiplcation task.  (However, the difference is probably negligible.)
