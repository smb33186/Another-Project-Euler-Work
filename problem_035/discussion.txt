Solution Discussion
===================
(2015/10/14)
	I pulled some code from a previous problem for generating the prime number
	reference set. Instead of dumping to a static, linkable file, I just decided
	to let it regenerate the primes each execution. Once the table was
	generated, it was just walking through and finding any candidates. No
	candidate circular prime could have an even number in it otherwise when it
	was in the lowest digit position, it would be divisible by 2 and wouldn't be
	a prime. This made eliminating primes a bit easier.
	Testing the primes was pretty simple: peal off the lowest digit and put it
	back in the highest position and then do a check against the reference
	table.
