Solution Discussion
===================
(2013/02/10)
After re-reading the problem description, I decided that 1 and above would be
the proper starting point.  I thought at first that anything under 24 would be
excluded since we knew that it was the smallest positive interger that could be
the sum of two abundant numbers.  But, after re-thinking it, that didn't make
sense for "all positive interger that couldn't be expressed as the sum of two
abundant numbers" to exclude these numbers.

	First try.  Just typed it up and ran it.  No surprise.

	Was starting non-two-abundant-sumable number search at 4, thought it needed
	to start higher since the lowest would be 24.  But that didn't work either.
