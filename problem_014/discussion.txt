Solution Discussion
===================
(2012/09/20)
After a quick failed attempted, I started thinking about the size of the numbers
that might be coming out.  Especially when I looked at two sequential numbers
and saw that they produced the exact same sequence length.  That struck me as
odd and I started wondering if I was getting value range problems.  I first
tried using unsigened ints and got a different answer.  That confirmed for me
that because I was using signed ints, the sign was probably causing overflow
issues.  For a final solution, I ran with unsigned longs instead.  But, 32-bits
was enough as long as they were not signed values.


Verification
============
2012/09/20 - Failed: 910107 with sequence length of 476
2012/09/20 - Succeed: 837799 with sequence length of 525
