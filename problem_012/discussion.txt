Solution Discussion
===================
(2011/01/08)

One small observation that I had was that the multiples should always be found
in pairs and the median number would always be <= sqrt(num).  This means when
searching for possible factors, we only need to search for the first half and
then double it.  All with exception of the case where the median number is equal
to the sqrt(num).  In this case, the median factor is squared and therefore only
counts as one factor.

I went with the simple approach and just figured out which numbers would divide
evenly into the given triangle number up to sqrt(num).

I did get a bit messed up though because I was adding something incorrectly and
I had my upper bound set too strictly and so I was stopping too early in some
cases.  Because my median number was the interger portion of a decimal number, I
ran into some cases where I would stop too soon if I was only looking for things
less than (not less than or equal) to my calculated max.
